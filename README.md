This project is a SENTIMENT ANALYSIS WEB APPLICATION that allows users to analyze the sentiment of a given text. The project consists of a simple web interface built using HTML and CSS on the frontend, while the backend is powered by a Flask application and the TextBlob library for natural language processing.

* Key Features:

  > User Input: Users can enter any text into a centered input box (textarea) on the webpage.

  > Sentiment Analysis: Upon submission, the text is sent to the Flask backend, where the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) is analyzed using TextBlob based on the polarity score of the text.

  > Real-time Output: The analyzed sentiment is displayed back on the same page, providing real-time feedback on the sentiment.

  > Responsive Design: The frontend design ensures that the input box and buttons are centered, with a clean, user-friendly layout.

* Technologies Used:

  > Frontend: HTML, CSS (flexbox for alignment).

  > Backend: Flask, TextBlob for sentiment analysis.

  > Framework: Flask handles the communication between the web form and the sentiment analysis logic.
